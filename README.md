# Adaptive Hologram Content Customization

## Overview
This project aims to develop an adaptive hologram system for Alter Learning's Hybrid Classroom environment. Using AI, the system dynamically adjusts hologram content complexity based on real-time student interactions, making learning experiences more personalized and effective. This adaptation helps students engage with the content at a level that matches their understanding and allows teachers to offer customized educational experiences.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Adjusts hologram details and complexity in response to student interactions.
- **Interactive AI Models**: Uses AI to analyze student comprehension and predict engagement, adjusting content accordingly.
- **Educational Flexibility**: Customizable holographic content across multiple subjects to support a range of educational goals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Unity** (2020 or newer): For VR or AR hologram environment creation.
- **Python**: For AI model training and initial data analysis.
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other ML frameworks for model development.
  
### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/adaptive-hologram-customization.git
   cd adaptive-hologram-customization
   ```

2. **Unity Setup**:
   - Open the Unity project by launching Unity and selecting the `adaptive-hologram-customization` folder.
   - Ensure that you have the latest Unity version to support VR/AR environments.

3. **Python Setup**:
   - Set up a Python environment for model training by installing required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install tensorflow
     ```
   - Run the initial model training script located in `AIModels/train_model.py`.

## How It Works
This adaptive hologram system includes two main components:

1. **AI Model for Comprehension Prediction**:
   - Trains on student interaction data to predict comprehension levels.
   - Adjusts hologram content complexity based on model predictions.

2. **Unity-Based Hologram Controller**:
   - A Unity script (`AdaptiveHologramController.cs`) uses the model’s predictions to alter hologram characteristics like size, detail level, and color in real-time.
   - This adaptation ensures that each student interacts with content at an appropriate level of complexity.

## Example Use Case
When a student interacts with a complex hologram model, the AI model analyzes their engagement level and comprehension. If the model detects that the student is struggling, it simplifies the hologram by reducing details or adding visual aids, allowing the student to grasp the content more effectively.

## Project Components

### AI Model Training
1. **Training Data**: Collect interaction data, including time spent, accuracy, and engagement level.
2. **Training Script**: Located in `AIModels/train_model.py`, this script prepares and trains a model that predicts student comprehension.
3. **Documentation**: Refer to `Documentation/ModelTraining.md` for detailed training instructions.

### Unity Integration
1. **Unity Scripts**: `AdaptiveHologramController.cs` manages real-time hologram adjustments based on comprehension level.
2. **Hologram Prefabs**: Found in `Assets/Prefabs/`, these are reusable 3D hologram models for educational subjects.
3. **Customization Options**: Use Unity’s Inspector to adjust parameters like color and detail for each hologram.

## Example Code Snippets

### Python AI Model Training (AIModels/train_model.py)
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def create_model(input_shape):
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)),
        layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Predicts comprehension level
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Example data - replace with real data
features = [[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]]
labels = [1, 0]

# Train model
model = create_model(input_shape=len(features[0]))
model.fit(features, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=2)
model.save('AIModels/adaptive_hologram_model.h5')
```

### Unity Hologram Adaptation Script (Assets/Scripts/AdaptiveHologramController.cs)
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class AdaptiveHologramController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject hologramContent;
    private float comprehensionLevel;

    void Start()
    {
        comprehensionLevel = GetComprehensionLevel();
        UpdateHologram();
    }

    float GetComprehensionLevel()
    {
        return Random.Range(0.0f, 1.0f);  // Replace with model integration
    }

    void UpdateHologram()
    {
        if (comprehensionLevel < 0.5f)
        {
            hologramContent.transform.localScale = new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f);
            hologramContent.GetComponent<Renderer>().material.color = Color.green;
        }
        else
        {
            hologramContent.transform.localScale = new Vector3(1f, 1f, 1f);
            hologramContent.GetComponent<Renderer>().material.color = Color.blue;
        }
    }
}
```

## Future Improvements
- **Model Optimization**: Integrate TensorFlow Lite or ONNX for efficient AI model deployment within Unity.
- **Real-World Data**: Replace placeholder data with actual student interaction data for better accuracy.
- **Advanced Feedback**: Add adaptive audio or text cues alongside hologram adjustments to enhance the learning experience.
