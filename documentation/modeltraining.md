# Model Training for Adaptive Hologram Customization and Haptic Feedback

## Overview
This document provides instructions for training, evaluating, and deploying an AI model to adapt hologram content and haptic feedback in real time based on student interactions. The model outputs two primary predictions:
1. **Comprehension Level**: Determines if students understand the current content and adjusts hologram complexity accordingly.
2. **Haptic Intensity**: Suggests haptic feedback intensity to guide or reinforce learning.

## Data Preparation

### 1. Collect Interaction Data
To create a robust model, collect comprehensive interaction data based on how students interact with hologram content. The key metrics to capture include:
- **Response Time**: How quickly students engage with and respond to holographic prompts or questions.
- **Interaction Accuracy**: The correctness of student actions (e.g., manipulating a 3D object to the correct orientation or selecting correct answers).
- **Number of Attempts**: How many tries students take to complete a task, which can indicate comprehension or difficulty level.

### 2. Label the Data
Each data point should be labeled with:
- **Comprehension Score**: Binary label where `1` indicates comprehension, and `0` indicates a need for simpler content or additional guidance.
- **Haptic Intensity**: A continuous value from `0.0` to `1.0` representing the desired haptic feedback intensity (0.0 = subtle feedback, 1.0 = strong feedback).

#### Sample Data Structure
| Response Time | Interaction Accuracy | Attempts | Comprehension | Haptic Intensity |
|---------------|----------------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1.2           | 0.85                 | 2        | 0             | 0.3               |
| 0.8           | 0.95                 | 1        | 1             | 0.7               |

## Model Training Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries like TensorFlow:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn
```

### 2. Model Architecture and Training Script
The training script is located in `AIModels/train_model.py`. This script builds a simple neural network model to predict comprehension and haptic intensity levels based on input features.

#### Key Model Details
- **Input Layer**: Accepts features such as response time, accuracy, and attempts.
- **Hidden Layers**: Two dense layers with ReLU activation for nonlinear transformations.
- **Output Layer**: Two outputs:
  - Comprehension Level (binary output)
  - Haptic Intensity (continuous output between 0 and 1)
  
The model is trained using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as the loss function.

#### Running the Training Script
To train the model, run the script with:
```bash
python AIModels/train_model.py
```

### 3. Evaluating the Model
The script evaluates the model on a hold-out test set and reports metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Loss**. Review these metrics to ensure the model is accurately predicting both comprehension and haptic intensity levels.

### Sample Script Output
```
Training the model...
Epoch 1/50
...
Model test loss: 0.05, Mean Absolute Error: 0.15
Model saved as adaptive_hologram_model.h5
```

### 4. Save the Trained Model
Once training is complete, the model is saved as `adaptive_hologram_model.h5` in the `AIModels` directory. This model can then be integrated into Unity for real-time predictions.

## Model Deployment in Unity

### 1. Convert the Model for Unity
Unity can load TensorFlow models directly with certain plugins (e.g., **TensorFlow for Unity**), but for better performance, consider converting the model to **TensorFlow Lite** or **ONNX** format for optimized use.

#### Convert to TensorFlow Lite
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('AIModels/adaptive_hologram_model.h5')

# Convert to TensorFlow Lite
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()

# Save the TFLite model
with open('AIModels/adaptive_hologram_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)
```

### 2. Import the Model into Unity
1. **Add the TensorFlow Lite Plugin** to Unity. You can find the [TensorFlow Lite Unity Plugin here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/unity).
2. Place the `.tflite` model file in the Unity project under `Assets/AIModels/`.
3. Use the TensorFlow Lite API to load and run predictions in Unity.

### 3. Unity Script for Real-Time Adaptation
To implement real-time adaptation based on model predictions, modify the Unity script `HapticFeedbackController.cs` to load the model and make predictions. Hereâ€™s an outline:

- **Load the Model**: Use TensorFlow Lite or a compatible plugin to load the `.tflite` model.
- **Run Predictions**: Feed interaction data into the model during runtime to get comprehension and haptic intensity predictions.
- **Adapt Hologram and Haptics**: Adjust hologram details and haptic feedback based on predictions.

## Example Code for Prediction in Unity
```csharp
// Placeholder code for loading and running predictions using TensorFlow Lite in Unity
using UnityEngine;
using TensorFlowLite;

public class AdaptiveHologram : MonoBehaviour
{
    private Interpreter interpreter;

    void Start()
    {
        // Load the TFLite model
        interpreter = new Interpreter(FileUtil.LoadFile("AIModels/adaptive_hologram_model.tflite"));
        interpreter.AllocateTensors();
    }

    public float[] Predict(float[] inputFeatures)
    {
        // Input and output data structures
        float[] output = new float[2];  // [comprehension, haptic intensity]

        // Run the model
        interpreter.SetInputTensorData(0, inputFeatures);
        interpreter.Invoke();
        interpreter.GetOutputTensorData(0, output);

        return output;
    }
}
```

## Testing and Fine-Tuning

1. **Test Predictions in Unity**: Integrate the prediction script with the hologram and haptic controllers to observe adaptive behaviors based on model outputs.
2. **Adjust Model Hyperparameters**: If the model performs poorly in testing, adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, or epochs in `train_model.py`.
3. **Real-World Data Collection**: As you gather more student interaction data, retrain and refine the model to improve accuracy.

## Future Improvements
- **Multi-Task Learning**: Implement multi-task learning to better predict both comprehension and haptic intensity.
- **Feature Expansion**: Capture additional features (e.g., student emotional state, focus duration) to improve model accuracy.
- **On-Device Optimization**: Explore optimized model formats like TensorFlow Lite with quantization to enhance performance on VR/AR devices.

## Conclusion
This adaptive model enables dynamic content and feedback in VR/AR, enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes. Following these steps will help you effectively train, deploy, and refine the model within Unity.
